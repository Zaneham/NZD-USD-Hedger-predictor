This repository contains my experiments with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for foreign exchange (FX) prediction.  
The goal is to explore how deep learning can be applied to time series forecasting in financial markets, and to build reproducible results that can be extended to live trading or hedging strategies.  

Iâ€™m currently using this as part of a side case study analysis Iâ€™ll be publishing. Iâ€™m constantly learning, so any feedback is appreciated!

##  Overview
This project applies LSTM models to FX data with the aim of predicting exchange rate movements.  
It focuses on:
- **Reproducibility** of experiments  
- **Automation** of workflows  
- **Integration** of external features such as sentiment and macroeconomic indicators  

---

##  Features
- Multivariate LSTM model for FX rate prediction  
- Integration of price data with external features (e.g., sentiment, macro indicators)  
- Automated logging and evaluation of predictions vs. actual outcomes  
- Configurable workflow using `.env` and YAML for reproducibility  
- Backtesting framework to benchmark model performance  
- Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for visualization and exploration  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Python** (TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)  
- **YAML** & `.env` for configuration management  
- **Matplotlib** for plotting results  
- **Streamlit** for a user-friendly app
